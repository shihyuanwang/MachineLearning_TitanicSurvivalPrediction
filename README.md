# Machine Learning - Titanic Survival Prediction

On April 15, 1912, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there were not enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1,502 out of 2,224 passengers and crew. Even though there was some element of luck involved in surviving, not all passengers had an equal chance to escape onto lifeboats and survive. It seems some groups of people were more likely to survive through the shipwreck than others. 

This project is designed to explore what factors would influence a passenger’s likelihood to survive using machine learning algorithms based on passenger data, including name, age, gender, and socio-economic class. The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic.
