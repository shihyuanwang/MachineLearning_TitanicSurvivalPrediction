# Machine Learning - Real Estate Value Prediction

**A. Introduction to topic:** 

Examining real estate valuation helps understand where people tend to live in a city. This project is designed to predict real estate value using machine learning algorithms and data collected from Xindian Dist., New Taipei City, Taiwan, based on several features, like transaction date, house age, transportation, and other amenities, that have an impact on a property value.


**B. Data sources:**

**C. Approaches and modelling techniques:** 

The project is to predict real estate value (house price of unit area). Approaches include loading data, analyzing exploratory data, transforming data (imputing missing values and performing feature scaling), fitting models, evaluating models, and summarizing results. Supervised (multiple linear regression, ridge regression & lasso, principal components regression (PCR) & partial least squares (PLS), generalized additive models (GAMs) - splines, tree-based (bagging, random forest, and boosting), and support vector machine (SVM)) learning modelling methods will be used.
